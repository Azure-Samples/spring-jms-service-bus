## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to use Spring JMS for Azure Service Bus Queue. 

Running this sample will be charged by Azure. You can check the usage and bill at this [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/account/).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can activate your [MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) or sign up for a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

* A [Java Development Kit (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/), version 1.8.

* [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/), version 3.0 or later.

## Quick Start

### Create Service Bus on Azure and Apply it's Properties

1. Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and create the service by following this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-create-namespace-portal). 

2. Update [application.properties](./src/main/resources/application.properties)

    ```
    # Fill service bus namespace connection string copied from portal
    spring.jms.servicebus.connection-string=[servicebus-namespace-connection-string]
    
    # The idle timeout in milliseconds after which the connection will be failed if the peer sends no AMQP frames
    # Default is 1800000
    spring.jms.servicebus.idle-timeout=[idle-timeout]
    ```

3. Specify your queue name. Update `QUEUE_NAME` in [QueueSendController](./src/main/java/sample/QueueSendController.java) and [QueueReceiveController](./src/main/java/sample/QueueReceiveController.java).
                                                                                                                                                                                    
### How to run

1. Run the `mvn clean spring-boot:run` in the root of the code sample to get the app running.

2. Send a POST request to service bus queue.
    ```
    $ curl -X POST localhost:8080/queue?message=hello
    ```
    
3. Verify in your app's logs that a similar message was posted:
    ```
    Sending message
    Received message from queue: hello
    ```
    
4. Delete the resources on [Azure Portal](http://ms.portal.azure.com/) to avoid extra charges.
